 In order to convert XLSB to JSON, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Cells 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET developers can easily load & convert XLSB files to JSON in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create instance of Workbook class & load XLSB file
1.  Get CellsCollection of the Worksheet containing the data
1.  Create a Range from CellsCollection by specifing row & column indices
1.  Call JsonUtility.ExportRangeToJson method with references to Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions objects
1.  Save the JSON data to file via File.WriteAllText method

 Before running the .NET conversion example code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

-  Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono or Xamarin Platforms.
-  Development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio.
-  Aspose.Cells for .NET DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows XLSB to JSON C# Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load XLSB file with an instance of Workbook
var workbook = new Cells.Workbook("J8CR782.xlsb", new Cells.LoadOptions(Cells.LoadFormat.Auto));
// access CellsCollection of the worksheet containing data to be converted
var cells = workbook.Worksheets[0].Cells;
// create & set ExportRangeToJsonOptions for advanced options
var exportOptions = new Cells.Utility.ExportRangeToJsonOptions();
// create a range of cells containing data to be exported
var range = cells.CreateRange(0, 0, cells.LastCell.Row + 1, cells.LastCell.Column + 1);
// export range as JSON data
string jsonData = Cells.Utility.JsonUtility.ExportRangeToJson(range, exportOptions);
// write data file to disc in JSON format
System.IO.File.WriteAllText("output.json", jsonData);

 An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print all Excel files. .NET Excel API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

XLSB file format specifies the Excel Binary File Format, which is a collection of records and structures that specify Excel workbook content. The content can include unstructured or semi-structured tables of numbers, text, or both numbers and text, formulas, external data connections, charts and images. Unlike XLSX (which is based on Open XML file format), the XLSB represents binary Excel workbook file. XLSB files can be read and written to faster which makes them useful for working with large files. XLSB is seldom used to store workbooks as XLSX (and previously XLS) are the most common user selected file formats for saving workbooks. It can be opened by Microsoft Office 2007 and above.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="json" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.
