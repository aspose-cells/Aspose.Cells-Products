 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert ODS files within running reporting applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

1.  Create an object of the IWorkbook class.
1.  Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
1.  Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
1.  Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
1.  Use ICell->PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
1.  Save the workbook as .ods file using Save() method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Sample code shows how to create ODS file in C++." offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

// Create an object of the IWorkbook class.
intrusive_ptr<IWorkbook> wkb = Factory::CreateIWorkbook();

// Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheetCollection> wsc = wkb->GetIWorksheets();
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheet> ws = wsc->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
intrusive_ptr<ICells> cells = ws->GetICells();

// Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell00 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 0);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell01 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 1);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell10 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(1, 0);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell11 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(1, 1);

// Use ICell->PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
cell00->PutValue(new String("ColumnA"));
cell01->PutValue(new String("ColumnB"));
cell10->PutValue(new String("ValueA"));
cell11->PutValue(new String("ValueB"));

// Save workbook to resultFile folder
wkb->Save(new String("created_one.ods"));

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ODS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ods/" >}}Files with .ods extension stand for OpenDocument Spreadsheet Document format that are editable by user. Data is stored inside ODF file into rows and columns. It is XML-based format and is one of the several subtypes in the Open Document Formats (ODF) family. The format is specified as part of the ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. A number of applications on Windows as well as other operating systems can open ODS files for editing and manipulation including Microsoft Excel, NeoOffice and LibreOffice. ODS files can also be converted into other spreadsheet formats as well like XLS, XLSX and others by different applications.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
