 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert GIF files within running reporting applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create an object of the Workbook class.
1.  Get the first sheet into a Worksheet object.
1.  Use Worksheet.GetCells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into a Cells object.
1.  Use Cells.Get() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into a Cell object.
1.  Use Cell.PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
1.  Save the workbook as .gif file using Save() method.

```cs
Aspose::Cells::Startup();

// Create an object of the Workbook class.
Workbook wkb;
// Get the first sheet into an Worksheet object.
WorksheetCollection wsc = wkb.GetWorksheets();
Worksheet ws = wsc.Get(0);


// Use Worksheet.GetCells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an Cells object.
Cells cells = ws.GetCells();


// Use Cells.Get() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an Cell object.
Cell cell00 = cells.Get(0, 0);
Cell cell01 = cells.Get(0, 1);
Cell cell10 = cells.Get(1, 0);
Cell cell11 = cells.Get(1, 1);


// Use Cell.PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
cell00.PutValue(u"ColumnA");
cell01.PutValue(u"ColumnB");
cell10.PutValue(u"ValueA");
cell11.PutValue(u"ValueB");


// Save workbook to resultFile folder
wkb.Save(u"created_one.gif");

Aspose::Cells::Cleanup();

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GIF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/" >}}A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
