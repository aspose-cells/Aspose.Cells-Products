 Generating MS Excel XLSM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create XLSM sheets from scratch having similar result as of New spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to create Charts, formulas, tables in newly created Excel sheet.

 It is easy for the developers to creat, load, modify and convert XLSM files within running reporting applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

1.  Create an object of the IWorkbook class.
1.  Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
1.  Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
1.  Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
1.  Use ICell->PutValue() method to add value to the cell.
1.  Save the workbook as .xlsm file using Save() method.

```cs
// Create a new workbook
intrusive_ptr<IWorkbook> wkb = Factory::CreateIWorkbook();

// Get the first worksheet
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheetCollection> wsc = wkb->GetIWorksheets();
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheet> ws = wsc->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Get cell(0,0)
intrusive_ptr<ICells> cells = ws->GetICells();
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 0);

// Write "relevant content" to cell(0,0) of the first sheet
intrusive_ptr<String> str = new String("related content!");
cell->PutValue(str);

// Save workbook to resultFile folder
wkb->Save(resultPath->StringAppend(new String("created_one.xlsm")));

An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print Excel XLSM files. Java Excel API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreadsheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoft&rsquo;s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.
