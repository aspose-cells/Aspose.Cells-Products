Creating a **Combo chart**—a chart that combines two different chart types such as *Column* and *Line*—is straightforward with Aspose.Cells for .NET. This feature enables you to visualise data with mixed chart types without requiring Microsoft Office on the server.

A Combo chart helps you compare distinct data series that have different value ranges or units, making it ideal for business reporting, dashboards, and analytical applications.

**Typical steps**

1. Include the required namespace.
2. Create a `Workbook` instance.
3. Populate worksheet cells with sample data.
4. Add a chart of type `ChartType.Column` (the base chart).
5. Convert the chart to a Combo chart.
6. Add a *Column* series and a *Line* series.
7. Set the secondary axis for the Line series (optional).
8. Save the workbook as an XLSX file.

Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful spreadsheet processing library that enables developers to **create**, **modify**, **convert**, **render**, and **print** Excel files across platforms without requiring Microsoft Office. Its rich API covers a wide range of charting scenarios, including Combo charts that combine multiple chart types in a single view.

XLSX, introduced with Microsoft Office 2007, is an Open XML based format that stores spreadsheet data, styles, and charts in a zip package containing XML parts. Aspose.Cells works directly with this format, allowing you to manipulate charts without extracting the package manually.
