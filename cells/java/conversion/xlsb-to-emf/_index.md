 In order to render XLSB to EMF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.Cells API makes it easy for the developers to convert XLSB file to EMF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load XLSB file with an instance of Workbook
1.  Select default or any Worksheet from the collection
1.  Create & set the object of ImageOrPrintOptions
1.  Create SheetRender with Worksheet & ImageOrPrintOptions objects
1.  Call SheetRender.toImage method to save result in EMF format

// access the default Worksheet from the collection
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
// define parameters for the resultant image
ImageOrPrintOptions options = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
options.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
options.setImageType(ImageType.EMF);
// convert worksheet to image in EMF format
SheetRender renderer = new SheetRender(worksheet, options);
renderer.toImage(0, "output.emf");

 Aspose.Cells API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

XLSB file format specifies the Excel Binary File Format, which is a collection of records and structures that specify Excel workbook content. The content can include unstructured or semi-structured tables of numbers, text, or both numbers and text, formulas, external data connections, charts and images. Unlike XLSX (which is based on Open XML file format), the XLSB represents binary Excel workbook file. XLSB files can be read and written to faster which makes them useful for working with large files. XLSB is seldom used to store workbooks as XLSX (and previously XLS) are the most common user selected file formats for saving workbooks. It can be opened by Microsoft Office 2007 and above.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
