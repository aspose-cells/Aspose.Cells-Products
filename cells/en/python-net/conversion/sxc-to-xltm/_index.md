        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLTM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xltm/" >}}
The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later does not support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.
