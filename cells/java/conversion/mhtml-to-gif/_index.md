 In order to render MHTML to GIF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert MHTML file to GIF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load MHTML file with an instance of Workbook
1.  Select default or any Worksheet from the collection
1.  Create & set the object of ImageOrPrintOptions
1.  Create SheetRender with Worksheet & ImageOrPrintOptions objects
1.  Call SheetRender.toImage method to save result in GIF format

 Before running the Java conversion source code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.Cells for Java directly from Maven.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="MHTML to GIF Java Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the MHTML file to be rendered
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("sourceFile.mhtml");
// access the default Worksheet from the collection
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
// define parameters for the resultant image
ImageOrPrintOptions options = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
options.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
options.setImageType(ImageType.GIF);
// convert worksheet to image in GIF format
SheetRender renderer = new SheetRender(worksheet, options);
renderer.toImage(0, "output.gif");

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. Microsoft Windows uses MHTML file format for recording scenarios of problems observed during the usage of any application on Windows that raises issues. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which is plain text email related specifications. The actual specifications of the format are as detailed by RFC 2557.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
