        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="CSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/csv/" >}}Files with .csv (Comma Separated Values) extension represent plain text files that contain records of data with comma separated values. Each line in a CSV file is a new record from the set of records contained in the file. Such files are generated when data transfer is intended from one storage system to another. Since all applications can recognize records separated by comma, import of such data files to database is done very conveniently. Almost all spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc can import CSV without much effort. Data imported from such files is arranged in cells of a spreadsheet for representation to user.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SQL" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/database/sql/" >}}A file with .sql extension is a Structured Query Language (SQL) file that contains code to work with relational databases. It is used to write SQL statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on databases. SQL files are common while working with desktop as well as web-based databases. There are several alternatives to SQL such as Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL), LINQ, HTSQL, 4D QL, and several others. SQL files can be opened by query editors of Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and other plain text editors such as Notepad on Windows OS.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
