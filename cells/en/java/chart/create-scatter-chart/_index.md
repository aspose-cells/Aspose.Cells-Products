Need to create Scatter Charts programmatically? Java developers can easily create Scatter Charts in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Include the namespace in your class file
1. Create [**Workbook**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/workbook/) class instance.
1. Add some data to worksheet cells with the [**Cell**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cell/) object's [**putValue**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/cell/#putValue-int-) method.
1. Add a [**SCATTER**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/charttype/) Chart to the worksheet by calling the [**Charts**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chartcollection/) collection's [**add**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chartcollection/#add-int-int-int-int-int-) method, encapsulated in the [**Worksheet**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/worksheet/) object.
1. Access the new [**Chart**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart/) object from the Charts collection by passing its index.
1. Set the chart's data source with [**Chart.setChartDataRange**](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/chart/#setChartDataRange-java.lang.String-boolean-) method.
1. Save as Excel or ODS files.

```cs

// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
// Obtaining the reference of the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// Adding sample values to cells
Cells cells = worksheet.getCells();
cells.get("A2").putValue("Category1");
cells.get("A3").putValue("Category2");
cells.get("A4").putValue("Category3");

cells.get("B1").putValue("Scatter");
cells.get("B2").putValue(324);
cells.get("B3").putValue(200);
cells.get("B4").putValue(450);

// Adding a Scatter chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.getCharts().add(ChartType.SCATTER, 6, 2, 20, 10);

// Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
Chart chart = worksheet.getCharts().get(chartIndex);

// Setting chart data source as the range "A1:B4"
chart.setChartDataRange("A1:B4", true);

// Save the Workbook as .xlsx file.
workbook.save("output.xlsx");
