```cs
// read JSON data file as string
String jsonInput = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("data.json")));

// create a blank Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
// access default empty worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// set JsonLayoutOptions for formatting
JsonLayoutOptions layoutOptions = new JsonLayoutOptions();
layoutOptions.setArrayAsTable(true);

// import JSON data to default worksheet starting at cell A1
JsonUtility.importData(jsonInput, worksheet.getCells(), 0, 0, layoutOptions);

// define parameters for the resultant image
ImageOrPrintOptions renderingOptions = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
renderingOptions.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
renderingOptions.setImageType(ImageType.TIFF);

// convert worksheet to image in TIFF format
SheetRender renderer = new SheetRender(worksheet, renderingOptions);
renderer.toImage(0, "output.tiff");

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
