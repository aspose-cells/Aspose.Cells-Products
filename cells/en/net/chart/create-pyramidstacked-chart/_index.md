Generating a Microsoft Excel workbook that contains a **Pyramid Stacked** chart is straightforward with Aspose.Cells for .NET. This chart type is ideal for visualising hierarchical data where each level of the pyramid represents a part of the whole, and the stacked sections show the contribution of individual series.
