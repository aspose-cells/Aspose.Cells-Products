 In order to convert MHTML to SVG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Cells.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

1.  Load MHTML file using Factory::CreateIWorkbook.
1.  Select the first worksheet.
1.  Set (SVG) options.
1.  Iterate through each page of sheet and render.
1.  Open SVG file in compatible program.

```cs

// Create string builder object for string concatenations.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder> sb = new Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder();

// Render each page to svg image one by one.
for (int i = 0; i Clear();
	sb->Append(outDir);

	// Get the output image path.
	StringPtr outputSVG = sb->ToString();

	// Convert worksheet to svg image.
	sr->ToImage(i, outputSVG);

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="MHTML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/mhtml/" >}}

Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. Microsoft Windows uses MHTML file format for recording scenarios of problems observed during the usage of any application on Windows that raises issues. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which is plain text email related specifications. The actual specifications of the format are as detailed by RFC 2557.

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
