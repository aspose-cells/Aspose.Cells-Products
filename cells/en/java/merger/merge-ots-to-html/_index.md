        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OTS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ots/" >}}A file with .ots extension is an OpenDocument Spreadsheet Template file that is created with the Calc application software included in Apache OpenOffice. Calc application software is the similar to Excel available in Microsoft Office. OTS file format is used to create templates that contain predefine settings related to styles, font, data, spreadsheet layout, and formatting. OTF files have mime-type application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet-template. These template files can be used as a starting point to generate and save actual data files that are saved in ODS file format. OTS files can be used with applications such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="HTML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/" >}}HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the extension for web pages created for display in browsers. Known as language of the web, HTML has evolved with requirements of new information requirements to be displayed as part of web pages.
