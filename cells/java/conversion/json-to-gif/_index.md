```cs
// create a blank Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
// access default empty worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// set JsonLayoutOptions for formatting
JsonLayoutOptions layoutOptions = new JsonLayoutOptions();
layoutOptions.setArrayAsTable(true);

// import JSON data to default worksheet starting at cell A1
JsonUtility.importData(jsonInput, worksheet.getCells(), 0, 0, layoutOptions);

// save resultant file in JSON-TO-GIF format
workbook.save("output.gif", SaveFormat.AUTO);

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="GIF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/" >}}

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
