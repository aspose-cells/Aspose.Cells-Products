XLSX is Microsoft Excel’s default file format introduced with Office 2007. It follows the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) and stores workbook data, styles, and charts as XML parts inside a ZIP container. Aspose.Cells works directly with this format, allowing you to generate and edit XLSX files on any platform.
