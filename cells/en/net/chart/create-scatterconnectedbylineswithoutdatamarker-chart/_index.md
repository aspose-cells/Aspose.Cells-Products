XLSX is the Open XML format introduced with Microsoft Office 2007. It stores spreadsheet data, styles, and charts in a zip package that contains XML parts. Aspose.Cells fully supports reading and writing this format, enabling creation of sophisticated charts such as ScatterConnectedByLinesWithoutDataMarker directly on the server.
