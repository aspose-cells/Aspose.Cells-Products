1.  Create an object of the IWorkbook class.
1.  Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
1.  Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
1.  Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
1.  Use ICell->PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
1.  Save the workbook as .mhtml file using Save() method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Following source code shows how to create a MHTML file using C++." offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

// Create an object of the IWorkbook class.
intrusive_ptr<IWorkbook> wkb = Factory::CreateIWorkbook();

// Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheetCollection> wsc = wkb->GetIWorksheets();
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheet> ws = wsc->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
intrusive_ptr<ICells> cells = ws->GetICells();

// Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell00 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 0);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell01 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 1);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell10 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(1, 0);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell11 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(1, 1);

// Use ICell->PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
cell00->PutValue(new String("ColumnA"));
cell01->PutValue(new String("ColumnB"));
cell10->PutValue(new String("ValueA"));
cell11->PutValue(new String("ValueB"));

// Save workbook to resultFile folder
wkb->Save(new String("created_one.mhtml"));

Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. Microsoft Windows uses MHTML file format for recording scenarios of problems observed during the usage of any application on Windows that raises issues. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which is plain text email related specifications.
