 In order to render JSON to ODS, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert JSON file to ODS in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create a new instance of Workbook class
1.  Select default or any Worksheet from the collection
1.  Load JSON data from file
1.  Create an instance of JsonLayoutOptions & set options
1.  Call JsonUtility.importData method with reference to Worksheet & data
1.  Save the Workbook in ODS format

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Before running the Java conversion source code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.Cells for Java directly from Maven.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/feature-section-col %}}

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="JSON to ODS Java Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// create a blank Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
// access default empty worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// set JsonLayoutOptions for formatting
JsonLayoutOptions layoutOptions = new JsonLayoutOptions();
layoutOptions.setArrayAsTable(true);

// import JSON data to default worksheet starting at cell A1
JsonUtility.importData(jsonInput, worksheet.getCells(), 0, 0, layoutOptions);

// save resultant file in JSON-TO-ODS format
workbook.save("output.ods", SaveFormat.AUTO);

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ODS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ods/" >}}

Files with ODS extension stand for OpenDocument Spreadsheet Document format that are editable by user. Data is stored inside ODF file into rows and columns. It is XML-based format and is one of the several subtypes in the Open Document Formats (ODF) family. The format is specified as part of the ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. A number of applications on Windows as well as other operating systems can open ODS files for editing and manipulation including Microsoft Excel, NeoOffice and LibreOffice. ODS files can also be converted into other spreadsheet formats as well like XLS, XLSX and others by different applications.
