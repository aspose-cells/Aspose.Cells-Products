 Generating MS Excel TSV file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create TSV sheets from scratch having similar result as of New spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to create Charts, formulas, tables in newly created Excel sheet.

 It is easy for the developers to creat, load, modify and convert TSV files within running reporting applications for data processing in just few lines of code.

1.  Create an object of the IWorkbook class.
1.  Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
1.  Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
1.  Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
1.  Use ICell->PutValue() method to add value to the cell.
1.  Save the workbook as .tsv file using Save() method.

```cs
// Create a new workbook
intrusive_ptr<IWorkbook> wkb = Factory::CreateIWorkbook();

// Get the first worksheet
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheetCollection> wsc = wkb->GetIWorksheets();
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheet> ws = wsc->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Get cell(0,0)
intrusive_ptr<ICells> cells = ws->GetICells();
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 0);

// Write "relevant content" to cell(0,0) of the first sheet
intrusive_ptr<String> str = new String("related content!");
cell->PutValue(str);

// Save workbook to resultFile folder
wkb->Save(resultPath->StringAppend(new String("created_one.tsv")));

An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print Excel TSV files. Java Excel API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}
A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.
