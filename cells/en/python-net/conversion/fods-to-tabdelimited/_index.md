        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="FODS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/fods/" >}}
A file with .fods extension is a type of OpenDocument Spreadsheet document format that stores data in rows and columns. The format is specified as part of ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. FODS files cannot be opened with Excel, another Spreadsheet software application by Microsoft. FODS files can be saved as ODS using LibreOffice and can be converted to other formats such as XLS and XLSX.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TABDELIMITED" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}
A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.
