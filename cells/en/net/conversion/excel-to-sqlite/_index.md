var tableName = "countrylanguage";
string excelFilePath = "SQLiteData.xlsx";
string autoIncrementColumnName = "id";

Workbook workbook = new Workbook(excelFilePath);
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

DataTable dataTable = worksheet.Cells.ExportDataTableAsString(0, 0, worksheet.Cells.MaxDataRow + 1, worksheet.Cells.MaxDataColumn + 1, true);

using (SQLiteConnection connection = new SQLiteConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();
    using (SQLiteTransaction transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
    {
        using (SQLiteCommand cmd = new SQLiteCommand())
        {
            cmd.Connection = connection;
            cmd.Transaction = transaction;

            foreach (DataRow dr in dataTable.Rows)
            {
                string columnNames = string.Join(", ", dataTable.Columns.Cast<DataColumn>()
                    .Select(c => $"`{c.ColumnName}`").Where(c => c != $"`{autoIncrementColumnName}`"));
                string valuesPlaceholders = string.Join(", ", dataTable.Columns.Cast<DataColumn>()
                    .Select((c, index) => $"@value{index + 1}")
                    .Where((val, index) => dataTable.Columns[index].ColumnName != autoIncrementColumnName));

                string insertCmd = $"INSERT INTO `{tableName}` ({columnNames}) VALUES ({valuesPlaceholders})";

                for (int i = 0; i < dataTable.Columns.Count; i++)
                {
                    if (dataTable.Columns[i].ColumnName != autoIncrementColumnName)
                    {
                        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue($"@value{i + 1}", dr[i]);
