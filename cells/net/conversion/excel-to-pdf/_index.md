1.  Load any of the Excel supported files via Aspose.Cells.Workbook constructor
1.  If no editing is required, simply call the Workbook.Save method
1.  Pass output file path with PDF extension as first argument
1.  Pass Aspose.Cells.SaveFormat.Pdf as second parameter

 Excel Spreadsheet Programming API has the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print all Excel files. .NET Excel API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange spreadsheets in industry-standard formats.

1.  Load the Excel file in an instance of Aspose.Cells.Workbook
1.  Create an instance of PdfSaveOptions and set SecurityOptions property
1.  Set passwords for UserPassword and/or OwnerPassword properties
1.  Disable content extraction by setting ExtractContentPermission to false
1.  Disable printing by setting PrintPermission to false
1.  Call Workbook.Save method with object of PdfSaveOptions class

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Un-secure PDF documents can be easily printed or extracted, therefore developers may need to encrypt PDF files with user and owner passwords, or just restrict content extraction and printing. In both cases,
 *Aspose.Cells.Rendering.PdfSecurity* 
 comes into play.

 Excel files can have any number of Worksheets with different number of rows & columns. A simple Excel to PDF conversion can generate several PDF pages for a Worksheet. Though it is possible to control the rendering process to have exactly one PDF page per Excel Worksheet.

 Excel files with several images may result in huge PDF file after conversion, therefore developers might need to compress images to reduce the output PDF file size and improve the overall conversion performance. This is possible with
 *PdfSaveOptions.SetImageResample(int PPI, int JpegQuality)* 
 method.

 PDF/A is an ISO-standardized version used for achieving purposes by embedding the used fonts within the PDF file. PDF/A differs from PDF by prohibiting features, such as font linking and encryption. If the requirements is to convert Excel to PDF/A then set
 *PDFSaveOptions.Compliance* 
 property before calling
 *Workbook.Save* 
 method.

Excel is a spreadsheet reader & writer application that majorly supports Open Office XML (OOXML) formats that became default since the release of Office Excel 2007. These formats include XLSX, XLSM, XLTX & XLTM. Excel also supports other formats that are not part of OOXML such as XLSB, XLA & XLAM.

PDF was created by Adobe in 1990s to introduce a standard document representation that is independent of software, hardware as well as OS. PDF files nowadays can contain text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata and 3D objects.
