How to create SVG file? With Aspose.Cells for Java library, you can easily create SVG file programmatically with  a few lines of code. [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) is capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print all Excel files. Java Excel API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS, CSV, SVG, JSON, WORD, PPT and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats. You can download its latest version directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert SVG files within running different reporting applications for data processing in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create an instance of [Workbook class](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook).
1.  Access the relevant worksheet using getWorksheets.get() method.
1.  Select the relevant cell, input the value into the desired cell using the cell name, like A1, B3, etc.
1.  Save the workbook as SVG format using the save() method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Sample code shows how to create SVG file in Java." offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

// Create a new workbook
Workbook wkb = new Workbook();

// Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
Worksheet worksheet = wkb.getWorksheets().get(0);

// Add relevant content in the cell
worksheet.getCells().get("A1").putValue("ColumnA");
worksheet.getCells().get("B1").putValue("ColumnB")
worksheet.getCells().get("A2").putValue("ValueA")
worksheet.getCells().get("B2").putValue("ValueB")

// Save the workbook as SVG file
wkb.save("Excel.svg"); 

// To enhance the code for further functionalities here are more functions
// getCells() and setValue for modifying the cell content
// getCharts().add() to add charts
// getPivotTables().add() for creating a Pivot Table
// getCells().get(int cell id).setFormula for adding cell level formula

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SVG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/svg/" >}}An SVG file is a Scalar Vector Graphics file that uses XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for building a website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
