Generating a Microsoft Excel XLSX file with a **DoughnutExploded** chart programmatically is straightforward with Aspose.Cells for .NET. This chart type is ideal for visualising proportional data where each segment is slightly separated from the centre, giving a “exploded” appearance.

The following guide demonstrates how to:

* Add sample data to a worksheet.
* Insert a DoughnutExploded chart.
* Configure the chart’s series, title and style.
* Save the workbook as an XLSX file.

The steps below show the minimal code required to generate a DoughnutExploded chart. The example is fully runnable and does not require Microsoft Excel to be installed on the server.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Install **Aspose.Cells** via NuGet (`Install-Package Aspose.Cells`).
2. Add the `using Aspose.Cells;` directive.
3. Create a `Workbook` instance.
4. Fill a worksheet with data.
5. Add a `Chart` of type `ChartType.DoughnutExploded`.
6. Define the data range for the chart series.
7. (Optional) Set a chart title and apply a built‑in style.
8. Save the workbook.

XLSX is the modern file format for Microsoft Excel workbooks introduced with Office 2007. It follows the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) and stores workbook data, styles, and relationships in a collection of XML parts compressed into a ZIP archive.
