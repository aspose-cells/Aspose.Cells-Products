{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsx/" >}}

XLSX is the modern Microsoft Excel file format introduced with Office 2007. It follows the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) defined in ECMA‑376, storing spreadsheet data as a collection of XML parts inside a ZIP container. Aspose.Cells works directly with this format, allowing you to read and write XLSX files without any external dependencies.
