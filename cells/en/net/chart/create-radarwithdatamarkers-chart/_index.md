XLSX is the modern Microsoft Excel file format introduced with Office 2007. It follows the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) defined in ECMA‑376, storing spreadsheet data as a collection of XML parts inside a ZIP container. Aspose.Cells works directly with this format, allowing you to read and write XLSX files without any external dependencies.
