Aspose.Cells for C++ is a programming interface for working with the Microsoft Excel application in a C++ environment. It allows developers to create, modify, and read Excel documents in a variety of formats, including XLSX, XLS, XLSM, XLSB, CSV and so on, using C++ code. It allow you to create new sheet, edit existing sheet, set styles and format, add charts and graphs and even generate pivot tables. It also support reading excel sheet and converting to other formats like PDF, HTML, ODS, CSV, SVG, JSON, XML, WORD, PPT and so on, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Convert programmatically NUMBERS to EMF format with a modern C++ API. Use just a few lines of code to convert NUMBERS to EMF. The Aspose.Cells library will allow any developer to easily solve the tasks of converting NUMBERS to EMF using the C++. For a more detailed description of the code snippet and other possible conversion formats, see the [Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/cells/cpp) pages. With Aspose.Cells for C++ library you can convert NUMBERS to EMF programmatically. Excel software from Aspose is ideal for individuals, small or large businesses. Since it is able to process a large amount of information, perform the conversion quickly and efficiently and protect your data. In order to convert NUMBERS to EMF, we will use [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Cells.Cpp/) package manager, search for Aspose.Cells.Cpp and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

The files with .numbers extension are classified as spreadsheet file type, that's why they are similar to the .xlsx files; but the Numbers files are created by using Apple iWork Numbers spreadsheet software. The Apple iWork Numbers is a unit software of the iWork Productivity Suite. The iWork Productivity Suite is equivalent to the Microsoft Office Suite that is used on Windows PCs. Hence, we can say the Numbers which is available for MacOS is also a competitor of Microsoft Excel. Likewise, Microsoft Excel, the NUMBERS file may also contain the tables, charts and formulas.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}
Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
