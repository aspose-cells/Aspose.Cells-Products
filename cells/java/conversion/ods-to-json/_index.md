Cells cells = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0).getCells();
// create & set ExportRangeToJsonOptions for advanced options
ExportRangeToJsonOptions exportOptions = new ExportRangeToJsonOptions();
// create a range of cells containing data to be exported
Range range = cells.createRange(0, 0, cells.getLastCell().getRow() + 1, cells.getLastCell().getColumn() + 1);
// export range as JSON data
String jsonData = JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson(range, exportOptions);
// write data to disc in JSON format
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.json"));
writer.write(jsonData);
writer.close();

Files with ODS extension stand for OpenDocument Spreadsheet Document format that are editable by user. Data is stored inside ODF file into rows and columns. It is XML-based format and is one of the several subtypes in the Open Document Formats (ODF) family. The format is specified as part of the ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. A number of applications on Windows as well as other operating systems can open ODS files for editing and manipulation including Microsoft Excel, NeoOffice and LibreOffice. ODS files can also be converted into other spreadsheet formats as well like XLS, XLSX and others by different applications.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.
