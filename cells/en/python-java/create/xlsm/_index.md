 Generating MS Excel XLSM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create XLSM documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, we will use
 [Aspose.Cells for Python](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells) 
 API that offers different features for spreadsheets creation, manipulation and conversion using Python platform. Developers can easily enhance code for writing data, generating charts or graphs as well as creating table in spreadsheets.

 An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print MS Excel XLSM files. Python API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreadsheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoftâ€™s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.
