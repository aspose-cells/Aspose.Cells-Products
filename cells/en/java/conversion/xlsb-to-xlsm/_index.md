Aspose.Cells for Java is a programming interface for working with the Microsoft Excel application in a Java environment. It allows developers to create, modify, and read Excel documents in a variety of formats, including XLSX, XLS, XLSM, XLSB, CSV and so on, using Java code. It allow you to create new sheet, edit existing sheet, set styles and format, add charts and graphs and even generate pivot tables. It also support reading excel sheet and converting to other formats like PDF, HTML, ODS, CSV, SVG, JSON, XML, WORD, PPT and so on, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

 In order to render XLSB to XLSM, we will use [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert XLSB file to XLSM in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load XLSB file with an instance of Workbook class
1.  Call Workbook.save method
1.  Pass output path with XLSM extension as parameter
1.  Check specified path for resultant XLSM file

XLSB file format specifies the Excel Binary File Format, which is a collection of records and structures that specify Excel workbook content. The content can include unstructured or semi-structured tables of numbers, text, or both numbers and text, formulas, external data connections, charts and images. Unlike XLSX (which is based on Open XML file format), the XLSB represents binary Excel workbook file. XLSB files can be read and written to faster which makes them useful for working with large files. XLSB is seldom used to store workbooks as XLSX (and previously XLS) are the most common user selected file formats for saving workbooks. It can be opened by Microsoft Office 2007 and above.

Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreadsheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoftâ€™s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.
