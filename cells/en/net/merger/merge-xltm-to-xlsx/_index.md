        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLTM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xltm/" >}}The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later does not support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsx/" >}}XLSX is well-known format for Microsoft Excel documents that was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Microsoft Office 2007. Based on structure organized according to the Open Packaging Conventions as outlined in Part 2 of the OOXML standard ECMA-376, the new format is a zip package that contains a number of XML files. The underlying structure and files can be examined by simply unzipping the .xlsx file.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
