+  Load all the TSV files with full path.
+  Make one document as the base file
+  Call the relevant method for concatenating and merging files one by one.
+  Call the Save() method and pass the file name (full path) and format (TSV) as a parameter.
+  Now you can open and use the TSV file in Microsoft Office, Adobe PDF or any other compatible program.

A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values. Read More
