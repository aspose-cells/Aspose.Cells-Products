 An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print CSV files. Python API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with .csv (Comma Separated Values) extension represent plain text files that contain records of data with comma separated values. Each line in a CSV file is a new record from the set of records contained in the file. Such files are generated when data transfer is intended from one storage system to another. Since all applications can recognize records separated by comma, import of such data files to database is done very conveniently. Almost all spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc can import CSV without much effort. Data imported from such files is arranged in cells of a spreadsheet for representation to user.
