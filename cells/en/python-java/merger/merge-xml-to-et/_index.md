        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/xml/" >}}XML stands for Extensible Markup Language that is similar to HTML but different in using tags for defining objects. The whole idea behind creation of XML file format was to store and transport data without being dependent on software or hardware tools. Its popularity is due to it being both human as well as machine readable. This enables it to create common data protocols in the form of objects to be stored and shared over network such as World Wide Web (WWW). The "X" in XML is for extensible which implies that the language can be extended to any number of symbols as per user requirements. It is for these features that many standard file formats make use of it such as Microsoft Open XML, LibreOffice OpenDocument, XHTML and SVG.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ET" readMoreLink="https://fileinfo.com/extension/et/" >}}An ET file is a teaching lesson created by Easiteach, a program that allows teachers to develop classroom lessons and deliver them through an interactive interface.
