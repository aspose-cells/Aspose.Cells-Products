     Convert Excel Spreadsheets to Several Formats
    </h2>
    <p>
     Aspose.Cells for SharePoint allows converting spreadsheets to many popular document and image formats from within the SharePoint document library. Aspose.Cells for SharePoint currently supports most of the spreadsheet formats along with CSV &amp; XML as input, and can export to spreadsheet formats as well as CSV, HTML, ODS, PDF, XML &amp; image formats.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2title">
     Concatenate Files During Conversion
    </h2>
    <p>
     Aspose.Cells for SharePoint provides the capability to combine files having different formats into one, single document. Moreover, you may also move documents in the list up or down to set the order in which you want the documents to be combined.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-lg-12">
    <h2 class="h2title">
     Convert Files in Subfolders
    </h2>
    <p>
     Aspose.Cells for SharePoint makes the conversion process more easy by recursively converting all of the documents and sub-folders under a selected folder. The existing sub-folder structure is created in the destination folder.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-lg-12">
    <h2 class="h2title">
     Overwrite Existing Files
    </h2>
    <p>
     If the destination folder already contains files with the same names as the ones you want to convert then Aspose.Cells for SharePoint allows you to overwrite existing files or you may simply select an option that will instruct the app to skip processing files that already exist in the destination folder.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-lg-12">
    <h2 class="h2title">
     Interact with Public API
    </h2>
    <p>
     For developers having internal SharePoint solutions, they can use Aspose.Cells for SharePoint's document conversion engine via its public API. It provides programmatic access to all supported formats and conversion options.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-lg-12">
    <h2 class="h2title">
     Microsoft Excel Automation – Not Needed
    </h2>
    <p>
     Aspose.Cells for SharePoint is built using managed code that never needs Microsoft Excel to be installed on the machine to work with Excel format conversion. It is a perfect Microsoft Excel automation alternative in terms of supported features, security, stability, scalability, speed and price.
