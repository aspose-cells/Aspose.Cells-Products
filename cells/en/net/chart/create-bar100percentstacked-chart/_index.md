Generating a Microsoft Excel XLSX workbook that contains a **100 % Stacked Bar** chart (ChartType.Bar100PercentStacked) is straightforward with Aspose.Cells for .NET. This type of chart visualises the relative contribution of each data series to a total, expressed as a percentage, and is ideal for showing part‑to‑whole relationships across categories.
