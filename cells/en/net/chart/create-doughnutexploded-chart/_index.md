Generating a Microsoft Excel XLSX file with a **DoughnutExploded** chart programmatically is straightforward with Aspose.Cells for .NET. This chart type is ideal for visualising proportional data where each segment is slightly separated from the centre, giving a “exploded” appearance.

The following guide demonstrates how to:

* Add sample data to a worksheet.
* Insert a DoughnutExploded chart.
* Configure the chart’s series, title and style.
* Save the workbook as an XLSX file.
