        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpg/" >}}A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLT" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlt/" >}}Files with .xlt extension are template files created with Microsoft Excel which is a spreadsheet application which comes as part of Microsoft Office suite. Microsoft Office 97-2003 supported creating new XLT files as well as opening these. The latest version of Excel is still capable of opening this old format template files. Such a template file is used to quickly create new Excel files with default data and settings such as page formatting, font size, margins, charts, etc which can be further saved as new .xls files.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
