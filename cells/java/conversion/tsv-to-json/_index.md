 Aspose.Cells API makes it easy for the developers to convert TSV file to JSON in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load TSV file with an instance of Workbook class
1.  Create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method
1.  Call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions
1.  Write String JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method

Workbook workbook = new Workbook("template.xlsx");
// access CellsCollection of the worksheet containing data to be converted
Cells cells = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0).getCells();
// create & set ExportRangeToJsonOptions for advanced options
ExportRangeToJsonOptions exportOptions = new ExportRangeToJsonOptions();
// create a range of cells containing data to be exported
Range range = cells.createRange(0, 0, cells.getLastCell().getRow() + 1, cells.getLastCell().getColumn() + 1);
// export range as JSON data
String jsonData = JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson(range, exportOptions);
// write data to disc in JSON format
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.json"));
writer.write(jsonData);
writer.close();

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}

A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.
