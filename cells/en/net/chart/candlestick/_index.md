The Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) chart uses five columns of data, in order: category, open, high, low, and close. The range of prices in each category is again indicated by a vertical line, while the range between open and close is given by a wider floating bar; if the price increases in the category (close is higher than open), the bar is filled with one color, while if the price decreases, the bar is filled with another. This type of chart is often called a candlestick chart.
