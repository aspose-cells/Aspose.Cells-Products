Based on structure organized according to the Open Packaging Conventions as outlined in Part 2 of the OOXML standard ECMA-376, the new format is a zip package that contains a number of XML files. The underlying structure and files can be examined by simply unzipping the .xlsx file.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="MHT" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/mht/" >}}A file with .mht extension is a MIME enabled archiving file format that contains different types of data into a single file. It can store data such as text, images, page styling in the form of CSS files, JavaScript, and other resources as embedded resources in it. MHT files, having MIME type message/rfc822, encapsulate all the contents of an HTML file as a single archive file for storing on archiving on storage devices.
