        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PRN" readMoreLink="https://fileinfo.com/extension/prn/" >}}A PRN file is a file created using the Print to File checkbox that appears within some Print dialog boxes on Windows. It contains a set of device-specific instructions that a printer, fax machine, or other device uses to print a document. PRN files may contain text or binary content, depending on the device the file was created for.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="HTML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/html/" >}}HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the extension for web pages created for display in browsers. Known as language of the web, HTML has evolved with requirements of new information requirements to be displayed as part of web pages. The latest variant is known as HTML 5 that gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from server, where these are hosted, or can be loaded from local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags and several others where each tag has start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
