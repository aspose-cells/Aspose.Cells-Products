 Generating MS Excel XLSM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create XLSM documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API that offers different features for spreadsheets creation, manipulation and conversion using Java platform. Developers can easily enhance code for updating cells data, generating charts or graphs as well as creating pivot table, adding cell level formulas and more in spreadsheets.

```cs
// Create a new workbook
Workbook wkb = new Workbook();

// Add relevant content in the cell
wkb.getWorksheets().get(0).getCells().get("A1").putValue("related content");

// Save as XLSM Excel file
wkb.save("Excel.xlsm"); 

// To enhance the code for further functionalities here are more functions
// getCells() and setValue for modifying the cell content
// getCharts().add() to add charts
// getPivotTables().add() for creating a Pivot Table
// getCells().get(int cell id).setFormula for adding cell level formula

Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreadsheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoft&rsquo;s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.
