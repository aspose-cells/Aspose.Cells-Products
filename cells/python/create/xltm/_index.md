 Generating MS Excel XLTM file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create XLTM documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Python](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells) 
 API that offers different features for spreadsheets creation, manipulation and conversion using Python platform. Developers can easily enhance code for writing data, generating charts or graphs as well as creating table in spreadsheets.

1.  Import asposecells in your code file.
1.  Create Workbook class instance.
1.  Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
1.  Get the desired cell(s) of the worksheet and input the value into the cell(s).
1.  Use Save method to save the workbook as XLTM file.
