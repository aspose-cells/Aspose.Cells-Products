        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="HTM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/htm/" >}}Files with .htm extension represent Hypertext Markup Language for creating web pages for display in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and a number of others. It defines the markups for creating static pages to be published on World Wide Web (WWW) for access by others. These markups tell the browsers how to display a web page��s contents. Such pages can contain plain text, images, hyperlinks to other pages, videos and other media information. When a web page is published, you can have a look at the markup code behind it by viewing its page source. Modern browsers allow to inspect each section of a web page where each sub-division or markup element in the HTM source is elaborated.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
