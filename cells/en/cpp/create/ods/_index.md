// Use Worksheet.GetCells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an Cells object.
Cells cells = ws.GetCells();


// Use Cells.Get() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an Cell object.
Cell cell00 = cells.Get(0, 0);
Cell cell01 = cells.Get(0, 1);
Cell cell10 = cells.Get(1, 0);
Cell cell11 = cells.Get(1, 1);


// Use Cell.PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
cell00.PutValue(u"ColumnA");
cell01.PutValue(u"ColumnB");
cell10.PutValue(u"ValueA");
cell11.PutValue(u"ValueB");


// Save workbook to resultFile folder

Data is stored inside ODF file into rows and columns. It is XML-based format and is one of the several subtypes in the Open Document Formats (ODF) family. The format is specified as part of the ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. A number of applications on Windows as well as other operating systems can open ODS files for editing and manipulation including Microsoft Excel, NeoOffice and LibreOffice. ODS files can also be converted into other spreadsheet formats as well like XLS, XLSX and others by different applications.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
