Aspose.Cells for .NET is a high‑performance, feature‑rich library that enables developers to create, manipulate, convert, render, and print Excel files without Microsoft Excel. It supports all mainstream spreadsheet formats (XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, ODS, CSV, and more) and provides extensive charting capabilities, including 3‑D, cylinder, and stacked chart types.

XLSX is the default file format for Microsoft Excel workbooks introduced with Office 2007. It follows the Open XML standard (ECMA‑376) and stores data, styles, and charts as a collection of XML parts inside a ZIP container. Aspose.Cells works directly with this structure, allowing you to manipulate charts such as the **CylindricalBar100PercentStacked** type without opening Excel.
