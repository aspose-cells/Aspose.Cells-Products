        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ODS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ods/" >}}Files with ods" extension represent plain text files that contain records of data with comma separated values. Each line in a ODS file is a new record from the set of records contained in the file. Such files are generated when data transfer is intended from one storage system to another. Since all applications can recognize records separated by comma, import of such data files to database is done very conveniently. Almost all spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc can import ODS without much effort. Data imported from such files is arranged in cells of a spreadsheet for representation to user.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}Files having extension .jpeg represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The JPEG file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
