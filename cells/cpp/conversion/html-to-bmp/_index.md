 In order to convert HTML to BMP, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Cells.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 C++ developers can easily convert HTML file to BMP in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load HTML file using Factory::CreateIWorkbook.
1.  Select the first worksheet.
1.  Set (BMP) options.
1.  Iterate through each page of sheet and render.
1.  Open BMP file in compatible program.

 Before running the C++ conversion sample code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with C++ Runtime Environment for Windows 32 bit, Windows 64 bit and Linux 64 bit.
- Aspose.Cells for C++ DLL referenced in your project.

```cs
// Output directory path.

// Create image or print options object.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Rendering::IImageOrPrintOptions> imgOptions = Factory::CreateIImageOrPrintOptions();

// Specify the image format.

// Get page count.
Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 pageCount = sr->GetPageCount();

// Create string builder object for string concatenations.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder> sb = new Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder();

// Render each page to bmp image one by one.
for (int i = 0; i Clear();
	sb->Append(outDir);
	sb->Append((StringPtr)new String("outputConvertingWorksheetToImageBMP_"));
	sb->Append(i);
	sb->Append((StringPtr)new String(".bmp"));

	// Get the output image path.
	StringPtr outputBMP = sb->ToString();

	// Convert worksheet to bmp image.
	sr->ToImage(i, outputBMP);

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the extension for web pages created for display in browsers. Known as language of the web, HTML has evolved with requirements of new information requirements to be displayed as part of web pages. The latest variant is known as HTML 5 that gives a lot of flexibility for working with the language. HTML pages are either received from server, where these are hosted, or can be loaded from local system as well. Each HTML page is made up of HTML elements such as forms, text, images, animations, links, etc. These elements are represented by tags such as img, a, p and several others where each tag has start and end. It can also embed applications written in scripting languages such as JavaScript and Style Sheets (CSS) for overall layout representation.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
