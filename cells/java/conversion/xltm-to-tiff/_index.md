 Aspose.Cells API makes it easy for the developers to convert XLTM file to TIFF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load XLTM file with an instance of Workbook
1.  Select default or any Worksheet from the collection
1.  Create & set the object of ImageOrPrintOptions
1.  Create SheetRender with Worksheet & ImageOrPrintOptions objects
1.  Call SheetRender.toImage method to save result in TIFF format

The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later doesn't support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
