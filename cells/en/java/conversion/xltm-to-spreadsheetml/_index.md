Aspose.Cells for Java is a programming interface for working with the Microsoft Excel application in a Java environment. It allows developers to create, modify, and read Excel documents in a variety of formats, including XLSX, XLS, XLSM, XLSB, CSV and so on, using Java code. It allow you to create new sheet, edit existing sheet, set styles and format, add charts and graphs and even generate pivot tables. It also support reading excel sheet and converting to other formats like PDF, HTML, ODS, CSV, SVG, JSON, XML, WORD, PPT and so on, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later does not support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SPREADSHEETML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/xml/" >}}
XML stands for Extensible Markup Language that is similar to HTML but different in using tags for defining objects. The whole idea behind creation of XML file format was to store and transport data without being dependent on software or hardware tools. Its popularity is due to it being both human as well as machine readable. This enables it to create common data protocols in the form of objects to be stored and shared over network such as World Wide Web (WWW). The "X" in XML is for extensible which implies that the language can be extended to any number of symbols as per user requirements. It is for these features that many standard file formats make use of it such as Microsoft Open XML, LibreOffice OpenDocument, XHTML and SVG.
