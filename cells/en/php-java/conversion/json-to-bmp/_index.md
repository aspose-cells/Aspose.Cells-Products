JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac.
