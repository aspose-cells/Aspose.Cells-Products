You don't want to see images stretched and compressed on any device?

You don't want the image to be blurry when zoomed in?

You don't want the image to be distorted at high resolution?

Maybe SVG is a good choice.SVG images look great at any zoom level, and they're resolution-independent.Due to the high fidelity of svg images, it is very popular among Excel users.

When you use Excel, you may encounter the following problems:

+  The target Excel file cannot be manually manipulated directly, and a program is required to process it.
+  Insert a large number of svg images into the same Excel file.
+  Insert svg images into a large number of different Excel files.

To solve these problems, we recommend you to use the [Aspose.Cells](https://products.aspose.com/cells/) library.It contains many common interfaces for processing excel files and is a very useful tool.

Microsoft Excel provides us with three ways to insert svg:

+  **Insert local SVG images/Icons**

You can simply drag and drop the SVG file to a specific location in the document. Or you can choose the "*Insert -> Picture -> This Device...*" path from the ribbon.

+  **Insert preset SVG images/Icons**

Microsoft Excel has provided us with preset svg pictures for us to choose. You can open the selection dialog by selecting the "*Insert -> Picture -> Stock Images...*" path from the ribbon. Most of the svg files are under the "Icons" option in Stock Images.

+  **Insert SVG images/Icons from the web**

If none of the above methods can meet your needs, you can also search for the results you want from the Internet through Microsoft Excel.You can open the selection dialog by selecting the "*Insert -> Picture -> Online Pictures...*" path from the ribbon.
