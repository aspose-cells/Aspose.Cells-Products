# Create Workbook object.
workbook = Workbook()

# Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

# Get the desired cell(s) of the worksheet and input the value into the cell(s).
worksheet.cells.get("A1").put_value("ColumnA")
worksheet.cells.get("B1").put_value("ColumnB")
worksheet.cells.get("A2").put_value("ValueA")
worksheet.cells.get("B2").put_value("ValueB")

# Save the workbook as TIFF file.
workbook.save("output.tiff")

It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
