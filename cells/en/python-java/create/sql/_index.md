It is used to write SQL statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on databases. SQL files are common while working with desktop as well as web-based databases. There are several alternatives to SQL such as Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL), LINQ, HTSQL, 4D QL, and several others. SQL files can be opened by query editors of Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and other plain text editors such as Notepad on Windows OS.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
