 In order to convert TSV to EMF, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Cells.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 C++ developers can easily convert TSV file to EMF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load TSV file using Factory::CreateIWorkbook.
1.  Select the first worksheet.
1.  Set (EMF) options.
1.  Iterate through each page of sheet and render.
1.  Open EMF file in compatible program.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Before running the C++ conversion sample code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with C++ Runtime Environment for Windows 32 bit, Windows 64 bit and Linux 64 bit.
- Aspose.Cells for C++ DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="TSV to EMF C++ Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// Output directory path.
StringPtr outDir = new String("OutputDirectoryPath");

// Load the TSV.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::IWorkbook> workbook = Factory::CreateIWorkbook(u"sourceFile.tsv");

// Access first worksheet.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::IWorksheet> worksheet = workbook->GetIWorksheets()->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Create image or print options object.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Rendering::IImageOrPrintOptions> imgOptions = Factory::CreateIImageOrPrintOptions();

// Specify the image format.
imgOptions->SetImageFormat(Aspose::Cells::Systems::Drawing::Imaging::ImageFormat::GetEmf());

// Specify horizontal and vertical resolution
imgOptions->SetHorizontalResolution(200);
imgOptions->SetVerticalResolution(200);

// Render the sheet with respect to specified image or print options.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Rendering::ISheetRender> sr = Factory::CreateISheetRender(worksheet, imgOptions);

// Get page count.
Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 pageCount = sr->GetPageCount();

// Create string builder object for string concatenations.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder> sb = new Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder();

// Render each page to emf image one by one.
for (int i = 0; i Clear();
	sb->Append(outDir);
	sb->Append((StringPtr)new String("outputConvertingWorksheetToImageEMF_"));
	sb->Append(i);
	sb->Append((StringPtr)new String(".emf"));

	// Get the output image path.
	StringPtr outputEMF = sb->ToString();

	// Convert worksheet to emf image.
	sr->ToImage(i, outputEMF);
}

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}

A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.


        {{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.
