        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSB" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsb/" >}}XLSB file format specifies the Excel Binary File Format, which is a collection of records and structures that specify Excel workbook content. The content can include unstructured or semi-structured tables of numbers, text, or both numbers and text, formulas, external data connections, charts and images. Unlike XLSX (which is based on Open XML file format), the XLSB represents binary Excel workbook file. XLSB files can be read and written to faster which makes them useful for working with large files. XLSB is seldom used to store workbooks as XLSX (and previously XLS) are the most common user selected file formats for saving workbooks. It can be opened by Microsoft Office 2007 and above.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OTS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ots/" >}}A file with .ots extension is an OpenDocument Spreadsheet Template file that is created with the Calc application software included in Apache OpenOffice. Calc application software is the similar to Excel available in Microsoft Office. OTS file format is used to create templates that contain predefine settings related to styles, font, data, spreadsheet layout, and formatting. OTF files have mime-type application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet-template. These template files can be used as a starting point to generate and save actual data files that are saved in ODS file format. OTS files can be used with applications such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
