 In order to convert XLSX to TIFF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Cells.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 C++ developers can easily convert XLSX file to TIFF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load XLSX file using Factory::CreateIWorkbook.
1.  Select the first worksheet.
1.  Set (TIFF) options.
1.  Iterate through each page of sheet and render.
1.  Open TIFF file in compatible program.

// Create string builder object for string concatenations.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder> sb = new Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder();

// Render each page to tiff image one by one.
for (int i = 0; i Clear();
	sb->Append(outDir);
	sb->Append((StringPtr)new String("outputConvertingWorksheetToImageTIFF_"));
	sb->Append(i);

	// Get the output image path.
	StringPtr outputTIFF = sb->ToString();

	// Convert worksheet to tiff image.
	sr->ToImage(i, outputTIFF);

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsx/" >}}

XLSX is well-known format for Microsoft Excel documents that was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Microsoft Office 2007. Based on structure organized according to the Open Packaging Conventions as outlined in Part 2 of the OOXML standard ECMA-376, the new format is a zip package that contains a number of XML files. The underlying structure and files can be examined by simply unzipping the .xlsx file.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TIFF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/" >}}

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
