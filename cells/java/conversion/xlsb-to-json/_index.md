 In order to render XLSB to JSON, weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.Cells API makes it easy for the developers to convert XLSB file to JSON in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load XLSB file with an instance of Workbook class
1.  Create a Range of data to be exported using Cells.createRange method
1.  Call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions
1.  Write String JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method

```cs

Workbook workbook = new Workbook("template.xlsx");
// access CellsCollection of the worksheet containing data to be converted
Cells cells = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0).getCells();
// create & set ExportRangeToJsonOptions for advanced options
ExportRangeToJsonOptions exportOptions = new ExportRangeToJsonOptions();
// create a range of cells containing data to be exported
Range range = cells.createRange(0, 0, cells.getLastCell().getRow() + 1, cells.getLastCell().getColumn() + 1);
// export range as JSON data
String jsonData = JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson(range, exportOptions);
// write data to disc in JSON format
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.json"));
writer.write(jsonData);
writer.close();

 Aspose.Cells API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. вЂЋ

XLSB file format specifies the Excel Binary File Format, which is a collection of records and structures that specify Excel workbook content. The content can include unstructured or semi-structured tables of numbers, text, or both numbers and text, formulas, external data connections, charts and images. Unlike XLSX (which is based on Open XML file format), the XLSB represents binary Excel workbook file. XLSB files can be read and written to faster which makes them useful for working with large files. XLSB is seldom used to store workbooks as XLSX (and previously XLS) are the most common user selected file formats for saving workbooks. It can be opened by Microsoft Office 2007 and above.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.
