 Generating MS Excel XLTX file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create XLTX documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API that offers different features for spreadsheets creation, manipulation and conversion using Java platform. Developers can easily enhance code for updating cells data, generating charts or graphs as well as creating pivot table, adding cell level formulas and more in spreadsheets.

1.  Create an instance of [Workbook class](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook).
1.  Access the relevant worksheet using getWorksheets.get() method.
1.  Select the relevant cell, input the value into the desired cell using the cell name, like A1, B3, etc.
1.  Save the workbook as XLTX format using the save() method.

```cs

// Create a new workbook
Workbook wkb = new Workbook();

// Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
Worksheet worksheet = wkb.getWorksheets().get(0);

// Add relevant content in the cell
worksheet.getCells().get("A1").putValue("ColumnA");
worksheet.getCells().get("B1").putValue("ColumnB")
worksheet.getCells().get("A2").putValue("ValueA")
worksheet.getCells().get("B2").putValue("ValueB")

// Save the workbook as XLTX file
wkb.save("Excel.xltx"); 

// To enhance the code for further functionalities here are more functions
// getCells() and setValue for modifying the cell content
// getCharts().add() to add charts
// getPivotTables().add() for creating a Pivot Table
// getCells().get(int cell id).setFormula for adding cell level formula
