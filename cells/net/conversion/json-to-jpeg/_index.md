```cs
// create a Workbook object
var workbook = new Cells.Workbook();
var worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// read JSON File
string jsonInput = File.ReadAllText("Data.json");

// set JsonLayoutOptions
var options = new Cells.Utility.JsonLayoutOptions();
options.ArrayAsTable = true;

// import JSON data to worksheet starting at cell A1
Cells.Utility.JsonUtility.ImportData(jsonInput, worksheet.Cells, 0, 0, options);

// define parameters for the resultant image
var options = new Aspose.Cells.Rendering.ImageOrPrintOptions()
{
    OnePagePerSheet = true,
    ImageType = Aspose.Cells.Drawing.ImageType.Jpeg
};
// convert worksheet to image in JPEG format
var renderer = new Aspose.Cells.Rendering.SheetRender(worksheet, options);
renderer.ToImage(0, "output.jpeg");

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="jpeg" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}
A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
