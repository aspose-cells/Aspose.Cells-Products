Files with XLS extension represent Excel Binary File Format. Such files can be created by Microsoft Excel as well as other similar spreadsheet programs such as OpenOffice Calc or Apple Numbers. File saved by Excel is known as Workbook where each workbook can have one or more worksheets. Data is stored and displayed to users in table format in worksheet and can span numeric values, text data, formulas, external data connections, images, and charts. Applications like Microsoft Excel lets you export workbook data to several different formats including PDF, CSV, XLSX, TXT, HTML, XPS, and several others. The XLS file format was replaced with a more open and structured format, XLSX, with the release of Microsoft Excel 2007. The latest versions still provide support for creating and reading XLS files, though XLSX is the first choice of use now.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="MHT" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/mht/" >}}
A file with .mht extension is a MIME enabled archiving file format that contains different types of data into a single file. It can store data such as text, images, page styling in the form of CSS files, JavaScript, and other resources as embedded resources in it. MHT files, having MIME type message/rfc822, encapsulate all the contents of an HTML file as a single archive file for storing on archiving on storage devices. Software applications such as Microsoft Word lets you convert your WORD documents to MHT by exporting as MHT file. MHT files can be opened using popular browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explore and Google Chrome.
