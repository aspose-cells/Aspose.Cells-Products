 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert OTS files within running different reporting applications for data processing in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create an instance of [Workbook class](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/com.aspose.cells/Workbook).
1.  Access the relevant worksheet using getWorksheets.get() method.
1.  Select the relevant cell, input the value into the desired cell using the cell name, like A1, B3, etc.
1.  Save the workbook as OTS format using the save() method.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Sample code shows how to create OTS file in Java." offSpacer="" %}}

```cs

// Create a new workbook
Workbook wkb = new Workbook();

// Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
Worksheet worksheet = wkb.getWorksheets().get(0);

// Add relevant content in the cell
worksheet.getCells().get("A1").putValue("ColumnA");
worksheet.getCells().get("B1").putValue("ColumnB")
worksheet.getCells().get("A2").putValue("ValueA")
worksheet.getCells().get("B2").putValue("ValueB")

// Save the workbook as OTS file
wkb.save("Excel.ots"); 

// To enhance the code for further functionalities here are more functions
// getCells() and setValue for modifying the cell content
// getCharts().add() to add charts
// getPivotTables().add() for creating a Pivot Table
// getCells().get(int cell id).setFormula for adding cell level formula

OTS file format is used to create templates that contain predefine settings related to styles, font, data, spreadsheet layout, and formatting. OTF files have mime-type application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet-template. These template files can be used as a starting point to generate and save actual data files that are saved in ODS file format. OTS files can be used with applications such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
