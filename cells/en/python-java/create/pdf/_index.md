 Generating PDF file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create PDF documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, we will use
 [Aspose.Cells for Python](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells) 
 API that offers different features for spreadsheets creation, manipulation and conversion using Python platform. Developers can easily enhance code for writing data, generating charts or graphs as well as creating table in spreadsheets.

 An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print PDF files. Python API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Portable Document Format (PDF) is a type of document created by Adobe back in 1990s. The purpose of this file format was to introduce a standard for representation of documents and other reference material in a format that is independent of application software, hardware as well as Operating System. The PDF file format has full capability to contain information like text, images, hyperlinks, form-fields, rich media, digital signatures, attachments, metadata, Geospatial features and 3D objects in it that can become as part of source document.
