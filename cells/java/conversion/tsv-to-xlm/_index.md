 Aspose.Cells API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}

A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlm/" >}}

XLM, for Excel Macro, is a type of Spreadsheet files that are used to store Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly for XLS file format and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.
