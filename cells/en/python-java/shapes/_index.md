In excel you can add shapes such as boxes, circles and arrows to documents, emails, slides and spreadsheets.To free you from a lot of manual insertion, the [Aspose.Cells for Python-Java](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/python-java) API provides the same functionality.These APIs are very easy to use, usually only one line of code is needed to insert a specific shape, and a few lines of code can complete the insertion of batches of shapes.

Insertting shapes using these APIs is simple. Process is, Create [Workbook class](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-java/asposecells.api/Workbook) object and select the first worksheet or the relevant sheet by providing its index. Add a shape to the worksheet by using [shapecollection](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/python-java/asposecells.api/ShapeCollection)â€™s Add method.
