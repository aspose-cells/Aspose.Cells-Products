// Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheetCollection> wsc = wkb->GetIWorksheets();
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheet> ws = wsc->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
intrusive_ptr<ICells> cells = ws->GetICells();

// Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell00 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 0);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell01 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 1);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell10 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(1, 0);
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell11 = cells->GetObjectByIndex(1, 1);

// Use ICell->PutValue() method to input value into the cell.
cell00->PutValue(new String("ColumnA"));
cell01->PutValue(new String("ColumnB"));
cell10->PutValue(new String("ValueA"));
cell11->PutValue(new String("ValueB"));

// Save workbook to resultFile folder
wkb->Save(new String("created_one.csv"));
