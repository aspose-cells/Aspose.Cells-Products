        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OTS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ots/" >}}A file with .ots extension is an OpenDocument Spreadsheet Template file that is created with the Calc application software included in Apache OpenOffice. Calc application software is the similar to Excel available in Microsoft Office. OTS file format is used to create templates that contain predefine settings related to styles, font, data, spreadsheet layout, and formatting. OTF files have mime-type application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet-template. These template files can be used as a starting point to generate and save actual data files that are saved in ODS file format. OTS files can be used with applications such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpg/" >}}A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
