 In order to render JSON to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.Cells API makes it easy for the developers to convert JSON file to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create a new instance of Workbook class
1.  Select default or any Worksheet from the collection
1.  Load JSON data from file
1.  Create an instance of JsonLayoutOptions & set options
1.  Call JsonUtility.importData method to import JSON data
1.  Create & set the object of ImageOrPrintOptions for JPEG rendering
1.  Create SheetRender for rendering
1.  Call SheetRender.toImage method to save result in JPEG format

```cs
// read JSON data file as string
String jsonInput = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("data.json")));

// create a blank Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
// access default empty worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// set JsonLayoutOptions for formatting
JsonLayoutOptions layoutOptions = new JsonLayoutOptions();
layoutOptions.setArrayAsTable(true);

// import JSON data to default worksheet starting at cell A1
JsonUtility.importData(jsonInput, worksheet.getCells(), 0, 0, layoutOptions);

// define parameters for the resultant image
ImageOrPrintOptions renderingOptions = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
renderingOptions.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
renderingOptions.setImageType(ImageType.JPEG);

// convert worksheet to image in JPEG format
SheetRender renderer = new SheetRender(worksheet, renderingOptions);
renderer.toImage(0, "output.jpeg");

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
