 An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print MS Excel XLS files. Python API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with XLS extension represent Excel Binary File Format. Such files can be created by Microsoft Excel as well as other similar spreadsheet programs such as OpenOffice Calc or Apple Numbers. File saved by Excel is known as Workbook where each workbook can have one or more worksheets. Data is stored and displayed to users in table format in worksheet and can span numeric values, text data, formulas, external data connections, images, and charts. Applications like Microsoft Excel lets you export workbook data to several different formats including PDF, CSV, XLSX, TXT, HTML, XPS, and several others. The XLS file format was replaced with a more open and structured format, XLSX, with the release of Microsoft Excel 2007. The latest versions still provide support for creating and reading XLS files, though XLSX is the first choice of use now.
