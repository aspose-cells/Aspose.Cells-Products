```cs
// read JSON data file as string
String jsonInput = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("data.json")));

// create a blank Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
// access default empty worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// set JsonLayoutOptions for formatting
JsonLayoutOptions layoutOptions = new JsonLayoutOptions();
layoutOptions.setArrayAsTable(true);

// import JSON data to default worksheet starting at cell A1
JsonUtility.importData(jsonInput, worksheet.getCells(), 0, 0, layoutOptions);

// define parameters for the resultant image
ImageOrPrintOptions renderingOptions = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
renderingOptions.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
renderingOptions.setImageType(ImageType.SVG);

// convert worksheet to image in SVG format
SheetRender renderer = new SheetRender(worksheet, renderingOptions);
renderer.toImage(0, "output.svg");

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
