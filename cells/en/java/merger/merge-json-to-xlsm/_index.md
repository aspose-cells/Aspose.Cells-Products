        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsm/" >}}Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreadsheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoftâ€™s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
