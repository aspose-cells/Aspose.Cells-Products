        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PNG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/" >}}A PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file is a raster image file format that uses lossless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports lossless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the widely used image file formats.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsm/" >}}Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreadsheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoftâ€™s Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
