XLSX is the modern Microsoft Excel file format introduced with Office 2007. It follows the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) and stores workbook data, styles, and charts in a collection of XML parts packaged in a ZIP archive. Aspose.Cells fully supports reading and writing this format, including all chart types.
