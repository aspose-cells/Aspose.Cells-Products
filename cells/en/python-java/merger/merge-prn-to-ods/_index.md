        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PRN" readMoreLink="https://fileinfo.com/extension/prn/" >}}A PRN file is a file created using the Print to File checkbox that appears within some Print dialog boxes on Windows. It contains a set of device-specific instructions that a printer, fax machine, or other device uses to print a document. PRN files may contain text or binary content, depending on the device the file was created for.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ODS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ods/" >}}Files with .ods extension stand for OpenDocument Spreadsheet Document format that are editable by user. Data is stored inside ODF file into rows and columns. It is XML-based format and is one of the several subtypes in the Open Document Formats (ODF) family. The format is specified as part of the ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. A number of applications on Windows as well as other operating systems can open ODS files for editing and manipulation including Microsoft Excel, NeoOffice and LibreOffice. ODS files can also be converted into other spreadsheet formats as well like XLS, XLSX and others by different applications.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
