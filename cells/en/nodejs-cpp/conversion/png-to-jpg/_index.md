        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PNG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/" >}}A PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file is a raster image file format that uses lossless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports lossless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the widely used image file formats.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpg/" >}}A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
