// Adding a chart to the worksheet

// Adding SeriesCollection (chart data source) to the chart ranging from A1 to B4

// Setting the chart type of 2nd NSeries to display as line chart
chart->GetNISeries()->GetObjectByIndex(1)->SetType(Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType::ChartType_Line);

// Saving the XLSM file
workbook->Save(outputChartTypeCustom);

//Similarly use API for creating Pyramid and bubble chart

Files with XLSM extension is a type of Spreasheet files that support Macros. From application point of view, a Macro is set of instructions that are used for automating processes. A macro is used to record the steps that are performed repeatedly and facilitates performing the actions by running the macro again. Macros are programmed with Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from within the Excel Workbook using the Visual Basic Editor and can be run/debug directly from there.
