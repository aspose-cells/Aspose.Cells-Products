        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TABDELIMITED" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SQL" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/database/sql/" >}}A file with .sql extension is a Structured Query Language (SQL) file that contains code to work with relational databases. It is used to write SQL statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on databases. SQL files are common while working with desktop as well as web-based databases. There are several alternatives to SQL such as Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL), LINQ, HTSQL, 4D QL, and several others. SQL files can be opened by query editors of Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and other plain text editors such as Notepad on Windows OS.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
