XLSX is the default workbook format for Microsoft Excel. Based on the Open XML standard (ECMA‑376), an XLSX file is a ZIP archive that contains a collection of XML parts describing worksheets, styles, charts, and other workbook elements. Aspose.Cells works directly with this format, allowing high‑performance generation and manipulation of Excel files on any platform.
