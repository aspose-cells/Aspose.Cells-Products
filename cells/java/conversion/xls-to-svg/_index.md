 In order to render XLS to SVG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert XLS file to SVG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load XLS file with an instance of Workbook
1.  Select default or any Worksheet from the collection
1.  Create & set the object of ImageOrPrintOptions
1.  Create SheetRender with Worksheet & ImageOrPrintOptions objects
1.  Call SheetRender.toImage method to save result in SVG format

 Before running the Java conversion source code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with Java Runtime Environment for JSP/JSF Application and Desktop Applications.
- Get latest version of Aspose.Cells for Java directly from Maven.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="XLS to SVG Java Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// load the XLS file to be rendered
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("sourceFile.xls");
// access the default Worksheet from the collection
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
// define parameters for the resultant image
ImageOrPrintOptions options = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
options.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
options.setImageType(ImageType.SVG);
// convert worksheet to image in SVG format
SheetRender renderer = new SheetRender(worksheet, options);
renderer.toImage(0, "output.svg");

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

Files with XLS extension represent Excel Binary File Format. Such files can be created by Microsoft Excel as well as other similar spreadsheet programs such as OpenOffice Calc or Apple Numbers. File saved by Excel is known as Workbook where each workbook can have one or more worksheets. Data is stored and displayed to users in table format in worksheet and can span numeric values, text data, formulas, external data connections, images, and charts. Applications like Microsoft Excel lets you export workbook data to several different formats including PDF, CSV, XLSX, TXT, HTML, XPS, and several others. The XLS file format was replaced with a more open and structured format, XLSX, with the release of Microsoft Excel 2007. The latest versions still provide support for creating and reading XLS files, though XLSX is the first choice of use now.

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
