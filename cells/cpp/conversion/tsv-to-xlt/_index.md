 In order to convert TSV to XLT, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Cells.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 C++ developers can easily convert TSV file to XLT in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Load TSV file using Factory::CreateIWorkbook.
1. Call the Save() method.
1. Pass the output file path with (XLT) file extension.
1. XLT file will be saved at the specified path.
1. Open XLT file in compatible program.

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}

A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.

Files with .XLT extension are template files created with Microsoft Excel which is a spreadsheet application which comes as part of Microsoft Office suite.  Microsoft Office 97-2003 supported creating new XLT files as well as opening these. The latest version of Excel is still capable of opening this old format template files. Such a template file is used to quickly create new Excel files with default data and settings such as page formatting, font size, margins, charts, etc which can be further saved as new .XLS files.
