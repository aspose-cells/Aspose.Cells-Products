 It is easy for the developers to create, load, modify and convert TSV files within running different reporting applications for data processing in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Create Workbook class instance.
1.  Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
1.  Get the desired cell(s) of the worksheet and input the value into the cell(s).
1.  Use Save method to save the workbook as TSV file.

```cs

from aspose import pycore
from aspose.cells import Workbook, SaveFormat, FileFormatType

# Create Workbook object.
workbook = Workbook()

# Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]

# Get the desired cell(s) of the worksheet and input the value into the cell(s).
worksheet.cells.get("A1").put_value("ColumnA")
worksheet.cells.get("B1").put_value("ColumnB")
worksheet.cells.get("A2").put_value("ValueA")
worksheet.cells.get("B2").put_value("ValueB")

# Save the workbook as TSV file.
workbook.save("output.tsv")

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
