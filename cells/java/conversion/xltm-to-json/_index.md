1.  Call JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson method with references of Range & ExportRangeToJsonOptions
1.  Write String JSON data to file via BufferedWriter.write method

Cells cells = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0).getCells();
// create & set ExportRangeToJsonOptions for advanced options
ExportRangeToJsonOptions exportOptions = new ExportRangeToJsonOptions();
// create a range of cells containing data to be exported
Range range = cells.createRange(0, 0, cells.getLastCell().getRow() + 1, cells.getLastCell().getColumn() + 1);
// export range as JSON data
String jsonData = JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson(range, exportOptions);
// write data to disc in JSON format
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.json"));
writer.write(jsonData);
writer.close();

The XLTM file extension represents files that are generated by Microsoft Excel as Macro-enabled template files. XLTM files are similar to XLTX in structure other than that the later doesn't support creating template files with macros. Such template files are used to generate and set the layout, formatting, and other settings along with the macros to facilitate creating similar XLSX files then.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JSON" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/json/" >}}

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.
