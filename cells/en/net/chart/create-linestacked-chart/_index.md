Whether you need to embed the chart in a reporting engine, a web service, or a desktop application, the following guide shows how to achieve this in just a few lines of code.

The process consists of preparing the data range, adding a chart object, setting its type to **LineStacked**, customizing series and appearance, and finally saving the workbook.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1. Include the required namespace in your source file.  
2. Instantiate the **Workbook** class.  
3. Populate a worksheet with sample data.  
4. Add a chart to the worksheet and set its type to **ChartType.LineStacked**.  
5. Configure chart title, axes, and series formatting.  
6. Save the workbook as an XLSX file.
