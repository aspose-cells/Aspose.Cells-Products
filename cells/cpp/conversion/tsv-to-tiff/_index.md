 In order to convert TSV to TIFF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 **Aspose.Cells.Cpp** 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 Aspose.Cells API makes it easy for the developers to convert TSV file to TIFF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load TSV file using Aspose.Cells for C++ Factory::CreateIWorkbook.
1.  Select the first worksheet.
1.  Set (TIFF) options.
1.  Iterate through each page of sheet and render.
1.  Open TIFF file in compatible program.

	// Get the output image path.
	StringPtr outputTIFF = sb->ToString();

	// Convert worksheet to tiff image.
	sr->ToImage(i, outputTIFF);

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/tsv/" >}}

A Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file format represents data separated with tabs in plain text format. The file format, similar to CSV, is used for organization of data in a structured manner in order to import and export between different applications. The format is primarily used for data import/export and exchange in Spreadsheet applications and databases. Each record in a TSV file is contained in a single line of text file where each field value is separated by a tab character. Media type for TSV file format is text/tab-separated-values.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TIFF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/" >}}

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
