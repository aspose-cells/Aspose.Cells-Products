{{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsx/" >}}

XLSX is the default file format for Microsoft Excel workbooks introduced with Office 2007. It is a ZIP‑based package that follows the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) and stores data in a collection of XML parts. Aspose.Cells works directly with this format, enabling high‑performance creation and manipulation of charts, formulas, and formatting.
