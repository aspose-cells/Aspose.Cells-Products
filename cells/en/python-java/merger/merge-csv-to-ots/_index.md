        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="CSV" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/csv/" >}}Files with .csv (Comma Separated Values) extension represent plain text files that contain records of data with comma separated values. Each line in a CSV file is a new record from the set of records contained in the file. Such files are generated when data transfer is intended from one storage system to another. Since all applications can recognize records separated by comma, import of such data files to database is done very conveniently. Almost all spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice Calc can import CSV without much effort. Data imported from such files is arranged in cells of a spreadsheet for representation to user.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="OTS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/ots/" >}}A file with .ots extension is an OpenDocument Spreadsheet Template file that is created with the Calc application software included in Apache OpenOffice. Calc application software is the similar to Excel available in Microsoft Office. OTS file format is used to create templates that contain predefine settings related to styles, font, data, spreadsheet layout, and formatting. OTF files have mime-type application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet-template. These template files can be used as a starting point to generate and save actual data files that are saved in ODS file format. OTS files can be used with applications such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
