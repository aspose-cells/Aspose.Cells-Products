Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful spreadsheet programming library that enables developers to create, modify, convert, render, and print Excel files across platforms. In addition to classic cell manipulation, the API provides rich support for a broad set of chart types—including Sunburst, Treemap, Funnel, and more—allowing you to deliver sophisticated visual analytics without Microsoft Excel installed on the server.
