 In order to convert XLSB to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.cells) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Cells.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 C++ developers can easily convert XLSB file to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load XLSB file using Factory::CreateIWorkbook.
1.  Select the first worksheet.
1.  Set (JPEG) options.
1.  Iterate through each page of sheet and render.
1.  Open JPEG file in compatible program.

 Before running the C++ conversion sample code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with C++ Runtime Environment for Windows 32 bit, Windows 64 bit and Linux 64 bit.
- Aspose.Cells for C++ DLL referenced in your project.

```cs

// Get page count.
Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 pageCount = sr->GetPageCount();

// Create string builder object for string concatenations.
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder> sb = new Aspose::Cells::Systems::Text::StringBuilder();

// Render each page to jpeg image one by one.
for (int i = 0; i Clear();
	sb->Append(outDir);
	sb->Append((StringPtr)new String("outputConvertingWorksheetToImageJPEG_"));
	sb->Append(i);
	sb->Append((StringPtr)new String(".jpeg"));

	// Get the output image path.
	StringPtr outputJPEG = sb->ToString();

	// Convert worksheet to jpeg image.
	sr->ToImage(i, outputJPEG);

 Excel API can be used to create, edit, convert and render Microsoft Excel formats to different formats. Moreover, it can be used for comprehensive charting, scalable reporting and reliable calculations within software applications. Aspose.Cells is a standalone API and it does not require any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="XLSB" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/xlsb/" >}}

XLSB file format specifies the Excel Binary File Format, which is a collection of records and structures that specify Excel workbook content. The content can include unstructured or semi-structured tables of numbers, text, or both numbers and text, formulas, external data connections, charts and images. Unlike XLSX (which is based on Open XML file format), the XLSB represents binary Excel workbook file. XLSB files can be read and written to faster which makes them useful for working with large files. XLSB is seldom used to store workbooks as XLSX (and previously XLS) are the most common user selected file formats for saving workbooks. It can be opened by Microsoft Office 2007 and above.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
