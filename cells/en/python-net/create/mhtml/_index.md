 Generating MHTML file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create MHTML documents from scratch without requiring MS Office, we will use
 [Aspose.Cells for Python](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-cells) 
 API that offers different features for spreadsheets creation, manipulation and conversion using Python platform. Developers can easily enhance code for writing data, generating charts or graphs as well as creating table in spreadsheets.

1.  Import asposecells in your code file.
1.  Create Workbook class instance.
1.  Access the first worksheet of the workbook.
1.  Get the desired cell(s) of the worksheet and input the value into the cell(s).
1.  Use Save method to save the workbook as MHTML file.

 An Excel Spreadsheet Programming Library capable of building cross-platform applications with the ability to generate, modify, convert, render and print MHTML files. Python API not only convert between spreadsheet formats, it can also render Excel files as images, PDF, HTML, ODS and more, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. Microsoft Windows uses MHTML file format for recording scenarios of problems observed during the usage of any application on Windows that raises issues. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which is plain text email related specifications.
