        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="NUMBERS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/spreadsheet/numbers/" >}}The files with .numbers extension are classified as spreadsheet file type, that's why they are similar to the .xlsx files; but the Numbers files are created by using Apple iWork Numbers spreadsheet software. The Apple iWork Numbers is a unit software of the iWork Productivity Suite. The iWork Productivity Suite is equivalent to the Microsoft Office Suite that is used on Windows PCs. Hence, we can say the Numbers which is available for MacOS is also a competitor of Microsoft Excel. Likewise, Microsoft Excel, the NUMBERS file may also contain the tables, charts and formulas. {{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
