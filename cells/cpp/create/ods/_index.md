 Generating MS Excel ODS file dynamically within running application is easy. In order to create ODS sheets from scratch having similar result as of New spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel without requiring MS Office, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Cells for C++](https://products.aspose.com/cells/cpp) 
 API that offers different features for document creation, manipulation and conversion using C++ platform. One can easily enhance code to create Charts, formulas, tables in newly created Excel sheet.

1.  Create an object of the IWorkbook class.
1.  Get the first sheet into an IWorksheet object.
1.  Use IWorksheet->GetICells() method to get the cells of the worksheet into an ICells object.
1.  Use ICells->GetObjectByIndex() method to access the desired cell of the worksheet into an ICell object.
1.  Use ICell->PutValue() method to add value to the cell.
1.  Save the workbook as .ods file using Save() method.

```cs
// Create a new workbook
intrusive_ptr<IWorkbook> wkb = Factory::CreateIWorkbook();

// Get the first worksheet
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheetCollection> wsc = wkb->GetIWorksheets();
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheet> ws = wsc->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Get cell(0,0)
intrusive_ptr<ICells> cells = ws->GetICells();
intrusive_ptr<ICell> cell = cells->GetObjectByIndex(0, 0);

// Write "relevant content" to cell(0,0) of the first sheet
intrusive_ptr<String> str = new String("related content!");
cell->PutValue(str);

// Save workbook to resultFile folder
wkb->Save(resultPath->StringAppend(new String("created_one.ods")));

Files with .ods extension stand for OpenDocument Spreadsheet Document format that are editable by user. Data is stored inside ODF file into rows and columns. It is XML-based format and is one of the several subtypes in the Open Document Formats (ODF) family. The format is specified as part of the ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. A number of applications on Windows as well as other operating systems can open ODS files for editing and manipulation including Microsoft Excel, NeoOffice and LibreOffice. ODS files can also be converted into other spreadsheet formats as well like XLS, XLSX and others by different applications.
