Aspose.Cells for Java is a programming interface for working with the Microsoft Excel application in a Java environment. It allows developers to create, modify, and read Excel documents in a variety of formats, including XLSX, XLS, XLSM, XLSB, CSV and so on, using Java code. It allow you to create new sheet, edit existing sheet, set styles and format, add charts and graphs and even generate pivot tables. It also support reading excel sheet and converting to other formats like PDF, HTML, ODS, CSV, SVG, JSON, XML, WORD, PPT and so on, thus making it a perfect choice to exchange documents in industry-standard formats.

 In order to render JPEG to SVG, we will use [Aspose.Cells for Java](https://products.aspose.com/cells/java) API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-cells) and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SVG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/svg/" >}}
An SVG file is a Scalar Vector Graphics file that uses XML based text format for describing the appearance of an image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text-based description of such files makes them independent of resolution. It is one of the most used formats for building a website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
