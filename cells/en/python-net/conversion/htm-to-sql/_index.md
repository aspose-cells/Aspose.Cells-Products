        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="HTM" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/web/htm/" >}}Files with .htm extension represent Hypertext Markup Language for creating web pages for display in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and a number of others. It defines the markups for creating static pages to be published on World Wide Web (WWW) for access by others. These markups tell the browsers how to display a web page��s contents. Such pages can contain plain text, images, hyperlinks to other pages, videos and other media information. When a web page is published, you can have a look at the markup code behind it by viewing its page source. Modern browsers allow to inspect each section of a web page where each sub-division or markup element in the HTM source is elaborated.{{< /blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text >}}
        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SQL" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/database/sql/" >}}A file with .sql extension is a Structured Query Language (SQL) file that contains code to work with relational databases. It is used to write SQL statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on databases. SQL files are common while working with desktop as well as web-based databases. There are several alternatives to SQL such as Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL), LINQ, HTSQL, 4D QL, and several others.
