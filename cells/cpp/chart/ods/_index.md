```cs
// Output directory path

// Path of output ODS file
StringPtr outputChartTypeCustom = outDir->StringAppend(new String("sourceFile.ods"));

// Create a new workbook
intrusive_ptr<IWorkbook> workbook = Factory::CreateIWorkbook();

// Get first worksheet which is created by default
intrusive_ptr<IWorksheet> worksheet = workbook->GetIWorksheets()->GetObjectByIndex(0);

// Adding sample values to cells
worksheet->GetICells()->GetObjectByIndex(new String("A1"))->PutValue(50);
worksheet->GetICells()->GetObjectByIndex(new String("A2"))->PutValue(100);

// Adding a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet->GetICharts()->Add(Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType::ChartType_Column, 5, 0, 20, 8);

// Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
intrusive_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Charts::IChart> chart = worksheet->GetICharts()->GetObjectByIndex(chartIndex);

// Adding SeriesCollection (chart data source) to the chart ranging from A1 to B4
chart->GetNISeries()->Add(new String("A1:B4"), true);

// Setting the chart type of 2nd NSeries to display as line chart
chart->GetNISeries()->GetObjectByIndex(1)->SetType(Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType::ChartType_Line);

// Saving the ODS file
workbook->Save(outputChartTypeCustom);

//Similarly use API for creating Pyramid and bubble chart

Files with ODS extension stand for OpenDocument Spreadsheet Document format that are editable by user. Data is stored inside ODF file into rows and columns. It is XML-based format and is one of the several subtypes in the Open Document Formats (ODF) family. The format is specified as part of the ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. A number of applications on Windows as well as other operating systems can open ODS files for editing and manipulation including Microsoft Excel, NeoOffice and LibreOffice. ODS files can also be converted into other spreadsheet formats as well like XLS, XLSX and others by different applications.
