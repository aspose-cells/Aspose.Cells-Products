// create & set ExportRangeToJsonOptions for advanced options
ExportRangeToJsonOptions exportOptions = new ExportRangeToJsonOptions();
// create a range of cells containing data to be exported
Range range = cells.createRange(0, 0, cells.getLastCell().getRow() + 1, cells.getLastCell().getColumn() + 1);
// export range as JSON data
String jsonData = JsonUtility.exportRangeToJson(range, exportOptions);
// write data to disc in JSON format
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.json"));
writer.write(jsonData);
writer.close();

A file with .fods extension is a type of OpenDocument Spreadsheet document format that stores data in rows and columns. The format is specified as part of ODF 1.2 specifications published and maintained by OASIS. FODS files cannot be opened with Excel, another Spreadsheet software application by Microsoft. FODS files can be saved as ODS using LibreOffice and can be converted to other formats such as XLS and XLSX.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format for sharing data that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data. JSON files are stored with the .json extension. JSON requires less formatting and is a good alternative for XML. JSON is derived from JavaScript but is a language-independent data format. The generation and parsing of JSON is supported by many modern programming languages. application/json is the media type used for JSON.
