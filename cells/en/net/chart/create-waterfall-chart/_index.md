Generating a Microsoft Excel XLSX file that contains a Waterfall chart dynamically within a running application is simple. To create XLSX documents with Waterfall charts from scratch—without requiring Microsoft Office—we will use **Aspose.Cells for .NET**. The API provides rich functionality for spreadsheet creation, manipulation, and visualization on any .NET platform.

A Waterfall chart helps visualize how an initial value is affected by a series of positive and negative values. With Aspose.Cells you can build such a chart in just a few lines of code.

1. Include the Aspose.Cells namespace in your class file.  
2. Create an instance of the **Workbook** class.  
3. Access the first worksheet of the workbook.  
4. Populate the worksheet with the data that will be represented in the Waterfall chart.  
5. Add a Waterfall chart to the worksheet and bind it to the data range.  
6. Optionally customize the chart title, legend, and formatting.  
7. Save the workbook as an XLSX file.

The code above creates a simple Waterfall chart that visualizes the flow from the **Start** value through **Sales**, **Expenses**, **Tax**, and finally calculates the **Profit** automatically.

Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful spreadsheet programming library capable of building cross‑platform applications. It enables developers to generate, modify, convert, render, and print Excel XLSX files. In addition to chart creation, the API supports conversion to PDF, HTML, images, ODS, and many other formats—making it ideal for enterprise‑grade document processing.

XLSX is the modern Open XML workbook format introduced with Microsoft Office 2007. It is a ZIP package that contains a collection of XML files describing worksheets, charts, styles, and other workbook components. Aspose.Cells works directly with the XLSX package, allowing full‑fidelity creation and manipulation without the need for Microsoft Office.
