Generating an Excel XLSX file that contains a Pyramid chart dynamically inside a running application is straightforward. In this article we demonstrate how to create a Pyramid chart without requiring Microsoft Office by using **[Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/cells/net)** – a powerful API for spreadsheet creation, manipulation and conversion on the .NET platform. The sample can easily be extended to add more data, customize chart appearance or embed the workbook into ASP.NET, WPF, or console applications.

Aspose.Cells is a cross‑platform .NET library that enables developers to create, modify, convert, render and print Excel spreadsheets without requiring Microsoft Excel. The API supports a wide range of chart types—including Pyramid, Funnel, Bar, Pie, Radar and more—allowing you to generate fully‑featured workbooks for reporting, analytics, or data‑visualisation scenarios.

XLSX is Microsoft Excel’s modern Open XML format introduced with Office 2007. It stores workbook data in a zip package containing multiple XML parts. Aspose.Cells works directly with these parts, making it possible to create or edit XLSX files on any platform that supports .NET.
